The **Online Voting System** is a secure platform designed to facilitate elections with enhanced voter authentication and security. It uses **face recognition** for voter registration and login, ensuring only authorized individuals can vote. After a successful face match, **two-factor authentication (2FA)** adds an additional layer of verification to prevent unauthorized access. Voters can cast their votes for ongoing elections, and the results are stored securely in a database. The system also features an **admin dashboard** for election management and real-time results viewing. Built with **Django**, **face_recognition**, and **2FA**, the system ensures a secure, user-friendly, and reliable voting process.
